My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

A license.txt file should have been included with this font, explaining the
license under which it is made available. You can also read it at:

About the font:

This font was inspired by titles I saw on a show about espionage.  I
made mine with an even thinner stroke weight.  So thin, in fact,
that it barely even shows up on the screen at small point sizes.  If
you aren't anti-aliasing (using font smoothing) this font will give
you real trouble unless you use a huge point size.

I made Secret Code with all caps in mind but I included lower case
letters and a full ASCII character set just in case I wanted them 
later.
